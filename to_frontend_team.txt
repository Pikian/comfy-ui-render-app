the frontend team can now find the generated media using the response we provide, which includes:
content_request_id: The unique identifier for their request
image_uuid: A unique identifier for the specific image
image_url: The direct URL to access the image


to make this more useful for their needs, I would ask them:
Post/Content Association:
Do you need to associate these images with specific posts or content in your database?
Should we include a post_id or content_id in the path structure? (e.g., comfyui-output/{post_id}/{content_request_id}/{image_uuid}.png)
Metadata Requirements:
Would you like additional metadata about the generation (prompt, seed, model used, etc.)?
Should we store this metadata in Supabase or return it in the response?
Multiple Images:
Do you need to handle multiple images per request?
Should we support batch generations with a single content_request_id?
Access Control:
Do you need different access levels for these images?
Should we implement any authentication for accessing the images?
Cleanup Policy:
Do you need a way to clean up old/unused generations?
Should we implement an expiration policy for generated images?
The current structure (comfyui-output/{content_request_id}/{image_uuid}.png) gives them a clear way to:
Track which request generated which image
Access the images via the provided URL
Organize images by request
But knowing their specific needs would help us enhance the system further. Would you like me to draft a message to the frontend team with these questions?
